# FarmConnect: A Farmer-Buyer Bidding System

This project, FarmConnect, is a Farmer-Buyer Bidding System developed as part of the IT214: Database Management Systems course at DAIICT. The aim of this project is to create a database management system using PostgreSQL that facilitates direct interaction between farmers and buyers, eliminating the need for intermediaries in the agricultural marketplace.

# Project Description

FarmConnect is a digital platform that connects farmers and buyers, enabling them to engage in direct transactions without the involvement of middlemen such as marketing yards. The system provides the following functionalities:

1. Individual Farmer Accounts: Farmers can create accounts to showcase their past harvest deals, current crop information, and profitability reports.
2. Buyer Profiles: Buyers can add information about the crops they want to buy, including crop name, quantity, and price range.
3. Marketing Yard Database: The system maintains a database of marketing yards that shows the current price of individual agricultural items, which is updated regularly.
4. Crop Suggestions and Predictions: The system suggests profitable crops for farmers based on past reports and current trends. It can also predict profitable crops for future growth based on the present crops grown.
5. Bidding System: The platform provides a bidding system that replaces the traditional middleman bidding at marketing yards.
6. Advanced Booking and Bidding: Farmers can secure advance bookings for specific crops from companies, and a bidding system replaces the traditional middleman bidding at marketing yards.

# Queries
1. Farmers: Farmers can view profitable crops to grow for the current year, list nearby area buyers and their requirements, add harvested crop details, and track crops that have been booked in advance by companies.
2. Buyers: Buyers can add crop requirements, negotiate prices with farmers, and plan fixed deal dates.
3. Admin: The admin has access to advanced features such as computing statistical data of last year's agriculture report, updating the prices of different agriculture products based on the current market status, and generating lists of nearby buyers for farmers and vice versa.
